		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>
			The challenge for this lab was to create a "FizzBuzz" function. The function
			loops through numbers from one to any inputted max number. The user will also
			input atleast one factor and nametag into the input field. After hitting the
			submit button, the function will apply the nametag(s) to any number that is a
			factor of the inputted factor(s). For example if the nametag was "fish", the factor
			was "2", and the current number was 4, the nametag "fish" would be applied to the number
			4 because 4 % 2 = 0. The results of this function are then displayed on the website.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="problems">
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>
			Formatting the output from the function gave me quite some trouble. I wanted to put
			my results into columns so the user would have an easier time viewing the information, however,
			using "float: left" on the assigned Divs within my output Div would break the visual integrity of the website.
			The results would be side by side, but the website background and output Div background would not apply
			to the results anymore. This confused me for sometime until I saw that my partner was using a css command
			called "column-width". This command completely solved my problem without the use of float left.

		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p>
			The Results Below allow the user to input factors, nametags, and a max number to see which numbers are
			factors of their inputted factors.
