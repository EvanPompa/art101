		<h3>Challenge</h3>
		<p>
			In this lab, we were tasked with creating a function and an anonymous function.
			Both functions had to manipulate an array of numbers in two different ways.
			Once these functions were created, we had to display our results to the console.
			Additionally, we could display our results within our webpage for extra points.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>
			Me and my partner were confused as to how '.innerHTML' worked. We did not know
			that we had to use it inside of a 'main' function. Aside from this there were no
			other problems.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="output">
		<h3> Results </h3>
		<p>Here is the output of my two functions. The numbers I used in my array
			are 1, -12, 500, 30, 24, -200. The first function modulus's the numbers
			and the second function squares the numbers. A screenshot of how this looks
			in the console will be posted directly below.
