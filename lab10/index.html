		<h3>Challenge</h3>
		<p>
			We had to use an input box and a button to gather an inputted name from the user. We then sorted this name
			using the .sort method. As a bonus we turned the name into an anagram.

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>
			Trying to turn the selected name into an anagram was difficult. We had a hard time scrambling the words effectively. I opted
			to delete a selected letter and replace it somewhere else. We also had a hard time finding which letters to make uppercase, but
			after using a for loop to find each element after a space, the problem was solved.
