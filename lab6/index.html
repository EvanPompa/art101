		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>
			For this lab my partner and I were tasked with creating an array and an object that described the type of vehicles we used. We had to create it first in the chrome console and then in Atom.

		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>
			I had a few typing errors when creating my function. I forgot to use the "return" statement and I forgot what types of braces the function needed.
			Luckily my partner, and the lecture slides were able to help me.
