		<h3>Challenges</h3>
		<p>
			For this lab, me and my partner made a function that sorts an inputted user's name and outputs it onto an HTML Page.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>Problems</h3>
		<p>
			Me and my partner were confused as to whether '.join' returned a value or not. I also mistakenly thought we were just reversing the user's name and not sorting it. Aside from some other
			minor spelling mistakes, there were no other issues with this lab.
